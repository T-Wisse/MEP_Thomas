## December plan
- List which genes make up which functional clusters.
    - First: cell polarity
- Download attribute data from yeastmine and SGD, as well as Genetic interaction data (SGA)
    - GO slim terms
    - protein-protein interaction
    - Common interactors
- Determine correlation of attributes with genetic interaction type
- Make a naive bayesian classifier using attributes that correlate with interaction type
- Evaluate performance of classifier
