## **What did I do?**
Read papers and document the important parts, mess around a bit more with git
## **What I will do today**
Attend meetings, some more reading, check out Leila's previous bioinformatics work on correlations between attributes of GIs like common interactors. Combined with existing research it may allow me to narrow down my classification approach or maybe conclude it won't be useful.
## **What is blocking me**
I found it difficult to focus on the reading after a while. Probably it is best to not try to read papers the entire day to prevent that, so I will mix with other tasks
