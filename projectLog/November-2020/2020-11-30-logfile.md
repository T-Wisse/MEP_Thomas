## **What did I do?**
Some reading, did not figure out how to use the yeastmine website
## **What I will do today**
Preparing for meetings, figure out the yeastmine website, reading, work on goals and approach
## **What is blocking me**
I don't have a good mindset for preparing for the meetings. This causes me to be stressed about it and makes it take longer. The yeastmine website confuses me, I may need to ask Leila about it.
