## **What did I do?** 
- Some additions to the proposal introduction. 
- Meetings and a workshop on phylogenetics.
-  Created a repo for this log 
## **What will I do?** 
- Continue with the introduction of the proposal. Again, I may start on the Bayesian classifier. 
## **What is blocking me?** 
- Still not sure how I will do the Goals/approach. Probably won't get to it today but I have to keep in mind not to stall on the introduction too long. 
- The exact content for the introduction should depend on what I will use later.
