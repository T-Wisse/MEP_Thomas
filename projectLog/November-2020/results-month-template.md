# Month
November

## What did I do in the month ?
A lot of literature research, worked on the proposal, changed my environment to help my work and started using github for communication. Form a bit of a plan of what I will do the coming month.

## Did I do all what I said I was going to do?
While I did not make a plan for this month beforehand, not really. I wanted have the proposal finished and already have at least the data I want to use for predicting genetic interactions. Maybe already get started with coding in python again.

## If not, why? 
I could definitely get more done than I have most days. Reading was slow going. If I communicated more of what I do with Leila I think I could have gotten more feedback and more done in general. For the proposal I think I need to set myself a deadline for when I should hand in a draft.

## What is next? 
Get all the data I need for predictions, identify modules I want to use with Leila's code, make a classifier using python which can predict a type of genetic interaction and evaluate how well it performs (or maybe another technique). Also finish the proposal. This is probably too ambitious due to christmas holidays, but I will at least try.
