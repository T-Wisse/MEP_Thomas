##**What did I do?** 
Figuring out how to work with git.
##**What will I do?** 
- Create a proper folder structure for the repo so I can work organized. 
- Address the issues about the purpose of a Bayesian classifier and my study of the genetic interaction data for cell polarity and morphogenesis.
-  Continue with the introduction.
##**What is blocking me?** 
- I did not properly document what I did and what I learned so just addressing the issues will take more time than necessary. Now I realise this I will take better care.
