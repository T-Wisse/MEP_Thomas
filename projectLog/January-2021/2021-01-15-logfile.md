## **What did I do?**
Finally managed to create individual figures. I also finally started going to the office again, which does seem to help in productivity and mindset.
## **What I will do today**
Evaluate made figures
## **What is blocking me**
For some reason the seaborn package does not do what I want. I may need to update to a new version but that is not working out.
