## **What did I do?**
Made a first draft for the plan for this month.
## **What I will do today**
Update the logs. I forgot to keep track for a while which defeats their purpose. Write the monthly reflection for November. Meet with Leila, do workshop on her repo, write the plan for coming month.
## **What is blocking me**
Yesterday was completely unproductive, I was tired all day and I could not focus, which frustrates me, which in does not help either. This happens more often. I think it partly comes from sitting inside behind my laptop all day. I will start doing some daily physical activity outside.
