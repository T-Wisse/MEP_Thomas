**What did I do?**
Some additions to the proposal introduction. Meetings and a workshop on phylogenetics. Created a repo for this log.
**What will I do?**
Continue with the introduction of the proposal. Again, I may start on the Bayesian classifier
**What is blocking me**
Still not sure how I will do the Goals/approach. Probably won't get to it today but I have to keep in mind not to stall on the introduction too long. The exact content for the introduction should depend on what I will use later.

**What did I do?**
Read the paper DeJesus et al 2017. Familiarized myself with the genes in the module cell polarity, which genes are important, what they do. Looked into which classifiers exist. 
**What will I do?**
Today I will start writing the proposal again. If I am stuck I may look more into what simple ways exist to predict an interaction and what I would need to implement them, maybe a bayes classifier? 
**What is blocking me**
I think I will get stuck on the approach, which may be helped by getting started with implementing a simple classifier. If I get stuck earlier I will ask Leila for feedback

**What did I do?**
Finish courses
**What I will do today**
Today I will download and study the genetic interaction data for cell polarity and morphogenesis. First I will just try to become familiar with it, but somehow I want to try to predict a specific interaction, even if for now its a bad prediction. Also I want to go through the paper greg will present tomorrow and attend the safety meeting.
**What is blocking me**
I am not sure where to start with creating a prediction. Also I am wondering what to do for the meetings tomorrow as currently I don't have anything to say.
