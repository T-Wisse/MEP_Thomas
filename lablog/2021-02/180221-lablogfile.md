## Genome prep
Using GeneMATRIX gram plus & yeast genomic DNA purification kit on yLL3a.
(copy protocol from kit)

Using 4*2ml pellet for a total of 8ml pellet and 4*30 uL elution buffer for a total of 120 microliter elution buffer.

## Checking DNA concentration

### nanodrop 
measurement of resulting DNA:
64.7 ng/ul
A260: 1,294, A280: 0,664, 260/280: 1,95, 260/230: 2,22

### Gel (small): 
1% agarose: 1g in 100ml TAE buffer. Heat -> mix, add 10uL of SybrSafe -> mix

Tighten mold in holder, put in comb (lane thingy) pour up to 50 ml of gel (50 is a lot, can be less).
Let solidify for 15-20 min. Remove comb and put the gel and mold in the electro machine (should be submerged in TAEbuffer, buffer has to be replaced every x runs).

Loading gel:
5 ul DNA + 1ul loading dye (dye must be diluted 6x, vortex beforehand)
flank samples with 10uL ladder (in the fridge)
apply red and black cables, 110V for 25 min, check that there are bubbles at the poles.

when working with the gel: always wear 2 gloves, waste goes to chemical waste.

Imaging gel:
Imaging room down stairs immediately left. Clean surface of machine, put in the gel carefully so it does not break (shallow angle). click something in the program (what?) -> align the gel by hand. -> image -> save (location: bulk tnw BN shared instruments Thomas-LL ) 

Annotate image (imagej) and measure DNA in the bands using ImageLab 6.1:
relative quatity: 2.74
reference: 100 ng
total amount of DNA: 100*2.74/5ul = 54.8 ng/ul
this is on the same order of magnitude as the nanodrop finds :)
approximate DNA concentration: (54.8+64.7)/2 ~= 60 ng/ul

## Preparing a glycerol stock
500 uL 80% glycerol (autoclaved). 1 ml cells from liquid culture.
