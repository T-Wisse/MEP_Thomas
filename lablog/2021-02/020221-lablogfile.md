## Growth in liquid media

pipet 10 ml YPD media into 10 ml glass tube (red cap which opens slightly with pressure inside)
scrape top of YLL3a tube using (yellow) pipet tip (yeast stock from -80 C freezer)
put pipet in the tube. Control without yeast. Put in the incubator at 30 C.

## Growth on agar plate

Collect yeast from stock using (yellow) pipet tip. Streak out on agar plate. Put plate in incubator.

### Checking for yeast with microscopy
Put 1 ml (?) on glass slide, put on coverglass. Observe small clumps and single yeast cells.

Put agar plate under microscope at 10x to observe individual colonies.

## Measuring cell concentration in culture
Using a spectrophotometer (nanodrop 2000c)
OD of overnight YLL3a culture in YPD

creating dilutions (1ml total):
| Dilution       | YPD + YLL3a   | YPD + YLL3a   |
|----------------|---------------|---------------|
| 0              | 1000 ul       | 0 ul          |
| 2x             | 500 ul        | 500 ul        |
| 5x             | 200 ul        | 800 ul        |
| 10x            | 100 ul        | 900 ul        |
| 20x            | 50 ul         | 950 ul        |
