**What did I do?** \
Figuring out how to work with git.\
**What will I do?** \
Create a proper folder structure for the repo so I can work organized. Adress the issues about the purpose of a bayesian classifier and my study of the genetic interaction data for cell polarity and morphogenisis. Continue with the introduction.
**What is blocking me?** \
I did not properly document what I did and what I learned so just adressing the issues will take more time than necessary. Now I realise this I will take better care.
