## What did I do?
- Read the paper DeJesus et al 2017. Familiarized myself with the genes in the module cell polarity, which genes are important, what they do. Looked into which classifiers exist. 
## What will I do?
- Today I will start writing the proposal again. If I am stuck I may look more into what simple ways exist to predict an interaction and what I would need to implement them, maybe a bayes classifier? 
## What is blocking me?
- I think I will get stuck on the approach, which may be helped by getting started with implementing a simple classifier. If I get stuck earlier I will ask Leila for feedback
