## What did I do?
- Finish courses
## What I will do today
- Today I will download and study the genetic interaction data for cell polarity and morphogenesis. - First I will just try to become familiar with it, but somehow I want to try to predict a specific interaction, even if for now its a bad prediction. Also I want to go through the paper greg will present tomorrow and attend the safety meeting.
## What is blocking me
- I am not sure where to start with creating a prediction. Also I am wondering what to do for the meetings tomorrow as currently I don't have anything to say.
